# MeTube App
The app is a replica of YouTube that offers a similar video streaming experience. The backend technology used is RapidAPI, specifically the YouTube v3 API, which provides access to a wide range of YouTube features such as video search. The frontend of the app is developed using ReactJS and Material UI, providing a modern and responsive user interface(desktop + mobile) that is easy to navigate and use.
